# DocumentValidation
WEB aplication that informs if a certain document is valid or not.

Please note that installation of OCR Tesseract is required to run Python code.

Once the "main.py" code has been executed, open the "http" address displayed in the terminal in your browser and select the desired files for validation.

Hope this simple code can help.

Have a nice day!
