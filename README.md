# DocumentValidation
WEB aplication that informs if a certain document is valid or not.

Please note that installation of OCR Tesseract is required to run Python code.

Create a folder called "templates" and place the files "index.html" and "result.html" inside of it.

Once the "main.py" code has been executed, open the "http" address displayed in the terminal in your browser and select the desired files for validation.

It's important to mention that this program works for Brazilian documents. For documents of other nationalities, it's important to make small changes to the python code.

Hope this simple code can help.

Have a nice day!
